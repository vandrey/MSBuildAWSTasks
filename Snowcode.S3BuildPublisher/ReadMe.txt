Usage
-----
You will need a AWS account with S3 enabled.  

On first pass modify the StoreKeys target to include your AWS keys.  ues MSBuild to execute that target
MSBuild PublishData.proj /t:StoreKeys

Once the keys have been stored, remove them from the file to prevent accidental checkin/distribution.

Subsequent uses, call the Debug target to copy files.
MSBuild PublishData.proj /t:Debug

Notes
-----
Don't use .'s in bucket names as they cause a "The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure." error.

Limitations
-----------
This does not handle sub directories.

Tasks:
-----
Implement CloudFront tasks to allow publish/update of CloudFront files as part of MSBuild.

Notes:
-----
If you stored your keys with a version before 1.0.0.10 they will need to be updated as salting has been added to the container.

Changes:
-----
